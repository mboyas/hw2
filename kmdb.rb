# In this assignment, you'll be using the domain model from hw1 (found in the hw1-solution.sql file)
# to create the database structure for "KMDB" (the Kellogg Movie Database).
# The end product will be a report that prints the movies and the top-billed
# cast for each movie in the database.

# To run this file, run the following command at your terminal prompt:
# `rails runner kmdb.rb`

# Requirements/assumptions
#
# - There will only be three movies in the database – the three films
#   that make up Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy
# - Movie data includes the movie title, year released, MPAA rating,
#   and director
# - A movie has a single director
# - A person can be the director of and/or play a role in a movie
# - Everything you need to do in this assignment is marked with TODO!

# Rubric
# 
# There are three deliverables for this assignment, all delivered within
# this repository and submitted via GitHub and Canvas:
# - Generate the models and migration files to match the domain model from hw1.
#   Execute the migration files to create the tables in the database. Add the
#   relevant association methods in each model. (5 points)
# - Insert the "Batman" sample data using ruby code. Do not use hard-coded ids and
#   delete any existing data beforehand so that each run of this script does not
#   create duplicate data. (5 points)
# - Query the data and loop through it to display output similar to the following
#   sample "report". (10 points)

# Submission
# 
# - "Use this template" to create a brand-new "hw2" repository in your
#   personal GitHub account, e.g. https://github.com/<USERNAME>/hw2
# - Do the assignment, committing and syncing often
# - When done, commit and sync a final time, before submitting the GitHub
#   URL for the finished "hw2" repository as the "Website URL" for the 
#   Homework 2 assignment in Canvas

# Successful sample output is as shown:

# Movies
# ======

# Batman Begins          2005           PG-13  Christopher Nolan
# The Dark Knight        2008           PG-13  Christopher Nolan

# The Dark Knight Rises  Joseph Gordon-Levitt  John Blake
# The Dark Knight Rises  Anne Hathaway         Selina Kyle

# Delete existing data, so you'll start fresh each time this script is run.
# Use `Model.destroy_all` code.
# TODO!

Movie.destroy_all
Person.destroy_all
Role.destroy_all

# Generate models and tables, according to the domain model
# TODO!

# I entered into terminal:
## rails generate model Movie
## rails generate model Person
## rails generate model Role

# Next, I added columns into db/migrate files
## Note - I used associations in the models to ease code below, so I used person_id in my movie table and person_id in roles table to make this work correctly

# Then, I executed migration by running in terminal:
## rails db:migrate

# Last, I added in relevant associations, see below:

# a movie has one director and many roles
##class Movie < ApplicationRecord
##    belongs_to :person
##    has_many :roles
##end

# each person can be in many movies or many roles
##class Person < ApplicationRecord
##    has_many :movies
##    has_many :roles
##end

# each role has 1 person and 1 movie
##class Role < ApplicationRecord
##    belongs_to :person
##    belongs_to :movie
##end

# Insert data into your database that reflects the sample data shown above
# Do not use hard-coded foreign key IDs.
# TODO!
